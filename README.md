# DScratch
a WIP port of Scratch to the Nintendo DS

the interpreter is written to be as authentic as possible so that most Scratch projects will work within limitations

<!--
requires:
- DSi or memory expansion
the best way to run DScratch (at least for large projects) (and on real hardware) is in the 3DS's DSi mode
-->

will support:
- most if not all blocks
- project playing
- project editing
- export to `.sb3`

# Installation
